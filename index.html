    <h4><u>My Biography and About Me</u></h4>
    <br>
    <p1>It's me, Etish Khanwal.
    I'm from a small Indian town called Una. I graduated my high school from D.A.V. Centenary Public School in 2021.I was a shy guy in school
    but now I am working on my communicaion skills and confidence.
    I enjoy viewing sci-fi movies and listening to music from other cultures since I have a distinct musical taste.
    I can be summed up in four words: joyful, playful, honest, and student.
    .My family includes Manvi, Hoshin, Honey, Harjit, and others.
    Basketball, cricket, skating, gymnastics, ping pong, and cricket are a few of my favourite sports and games.
    Now, about the pet: Max is the name of the dog I have. He is a friendly dog who barks on everyone(lol).
    There are three things that bring me joy: music, staying up late, and skipping schoolwork
    History and science are my two favourite topics.
    Beach, Montreal, and Nanny's home are some of my favourite enjoyable destinations.
    I enjoy pizza and butter chicken.
    I have a cool fact that not many people know: I can sleep for up to 14 hours straight without getting up.</p1>

    <h3> <u>Skills and Experience</u> </h3>
    I don't have a lot of experience in a particular sector because I'm just 19 years old, 
    but I do know a lot about security, computers, technological features, cashier job, and other things
    I never arrive late for scheduled activities, whether they are linked to my job or not
    .In my very first cross-fit competition, I took first place.
    I am constantly really excited about my job and the next responsibilities.
    I'm  quite outgoing, and do well in a supportive work atmosphere.
